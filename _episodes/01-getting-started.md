There are three components that are essential to running a workshop.

* Finding a space
* Finding people
	* Instructors
	* Helpers
	* Audience

There is more work to be done after this, but these are the three things
that need to be locked down, or you don't have a workshop.  

## Place

Workshops require space. This is usually the most important thing to start
with; not just because it's needed, but because it often needs to be booked
weeks to months in advance.  

This link has a great list of qualities to look for in a workshop space:

## People, Part 1: Instructors and Helpers



## People, Part 2: Audience

*You* may be on fire to run a Carpentries workshop, and may even have roped
some friends or colleagues into helping you, but it'll be a lot of effort
for nothing if you don't start with at least some idea of an audience in mind.

Places to start looking for an audience:
- your own experience
- target groups
- connections

A word of caution: especially if this is your first time organizing a workshop,
make sure that expectations are managed.
