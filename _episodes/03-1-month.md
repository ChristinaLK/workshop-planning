One month before your workshop, it's time to make sure that instructors and
learners are all getting set and on the same page.

## Participants

At this point, registration should be open, if it isn't already.  You probably
have some questions coming in that you have to keep up with.  

If your workshop isn't full yet, do some more advertising.

## Instructors

In this period the instructors should meet and:
* get to know each another
* discuss who is teaching what
* discuss any changes or customizations to the material, including order of topics

This meeting may be organized by a "lead
instructor", but can be initiated and facilitated by you, the host.  

Another thing to consider at this point is post-workshop outreach.  Carpentries
communities have tried many post-workshop options.
