preparing items, sending emails, responding to emails, managing registration, and so on.  

Some concrete tasks that you can/should do: 

# 7 days before the workshop

# Sometime in the week before the workshop

Email participants about SW install / releasing registration
Print cheatsheets or other materials
Release waitlist (if appropriate)
Look at pre-workshop surveys

# 1-2 days before the workshop

Email participants again with last minute reminders
Check in with instructors
