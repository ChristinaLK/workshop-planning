There's not a clear time to perform the steps in this episode of the lesson.  Anywhere
from 4 - 12 weeks before your workshop could be an appropriate time to do the following
things.  Earlier is better, especially if you want to do a fair bit of advertising.

## Set up registration

You can use any system you want to register people for your workshop, but
make sure you have some system!  Common solutions include Eventbrite, Google
Forms, or a local institutional resource.

The key components you want to get from a registration system are collecting
emails, so you can contact participants, and, if charging for the workshop,
a way to collect money. Being able to customize the page that shows up after
you register is also really helpful; as this is where you can point people
at the pre-workshop survey.  

Registration tips + tricks:
- set to open 2-3 weeks before workshop
- allow a few more seats than you have

### To Pay or Not to Pay?

Important considerations when deciding whether to charge (and how much):
* Local rules and systems
* Room availability
* Accessibility
* Funding sources

## Create a workshop website

By now you should have all the information you need to generate a web page
that serves as the general hub of information for your workshop: advertisement,
registration, schedule, and set up information.

## Fill out the request form

Even if you are self-organizing a workshop, it's important to report back
to the parent Carpentries organization.  If you are partnering with the Carpentries
to organize, you will have filled this out already.

## Arrange for food (optional)




## Start advertising

One your website is ready, you can start advertising!  Tell people that
the workshop is happening and when registration will open (if it isn't immediately.)

Advertising suggestions:
* Mailing lists - this can run the gamut from informational lists that
produce newsletters, to research-centric or grad-student centric networking
lists, to the mailing list of a center or department.
* Social media
* Specific groups (lab group, class)

## Code of Conduct

Review the Carpentries Code of Conduct and make sure you understand it.
